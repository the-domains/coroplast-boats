So I love boats. At least paddle boats. I'm always interested in different ways to construct them. Lighter the better. Yet sturdy. And cheap is always great. 

I saw this cool new kayak made out of coroplast and it seems to be quite light and pretty strong. It's called the Oru kayak. It got me to wondering if there were any do it yourselfers out there. Seems that there are. This one I found is from Japan. I really don't care much about folding it up to transport. Getting a lightweight, sturdy canoe on the cheap would be enough.

Apparently the Oru was not sold in Japan at the time. He worked from a cad drawing that he made. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aa5c4f4b-91c5-4289-9b9f-104860f0c543.jpg)

He used four sheets of coroplast and taped them together. Here is a picture of it just before the final fold.

And here is the "final" boat.

Pretty nice job. In later posts he talks about needing improvements.
